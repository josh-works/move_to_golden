OK, time-trialing this thing a bit, in the same way I have time-trialed these many prior projects:

- examples 1 - 5

I want to get a minimum-viable-page up and running, as quickly as possible, deployed to production and visitable on [movetogolden.com]().

Remember, I promised my cousin some simple solution worth attending to (on Christmas day) and bought this domain then-and-there on my phone, so I have to prove I'm a Real Software Developer. 

What would you expect to find at `movetogolden.com`? I have some ideas, but at minimum, I'd expect information about moving to Golden. 

Or, rather, information about Golden as might be germane to someone thinking about moving to Golden. 

That would be dispensed over time, as well, so I'd expect a message kinda like:

> learn more over the next few days, weeks, and months about someday (possibly) thinking about moving to Golden, Colorado, as told from the perspective of someone who just moved here, and _very likely_ feels similarly to you about some of the issues we all face related to people moving around.

Maybe that drops them into a convertkit landing sequence. I'd sketch out a sequence, from zero to <current>, and run everything through it.

Talk about building in public, of course. That's what this is. I'm interested in making money, and between the huge emotional encouragement that "small" sums of money (earned over the internet!) represents, especially that sweet sweet MRR, i'll be building out options to "collect" all of that, for learning practice, and I'll dedicate at least as much time (maybe more) to marketing and product research, as I do to engineering and development. 

I'll write it all.

OK. I'm about ten minutes in, and I've got nothing, either on the domain, or even in ruby/rails. (I've been waiting for the current version of ruby and rails to install on my laptop, but I'm on crappy library wifi, and it's been buggy.)

What I've accomplished in this session:

1. The above thoughts, plus some conversation with friends. (And some early buy-in. Thanks Akira, and my cousin!)
2. ran the following commands

```
rvm install 3.1.0
gem install rails
rails new movetogolden
cd movetogolden
```

Ran into errors on `bundle install`, starting with:
